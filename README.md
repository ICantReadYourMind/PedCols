# PedColsVC
This mod adds varying pedestrian colours to GTA Vice City.
 
 
### To use this, the pedestrian models have to be adjusted. The materials for which you want colours to change must be like this:



First material- R:0 G:0xFF B:0x3C

Second material- R:0xFF G:0 B:0xAF

Third material- R:0x3C G:0 B:0xFF

Fourth material- R:0xFF G:0 B:0x3C


Then, the pedcols.dat should be adjusted accordingly. There is an example pedcols.dat in the source folder and in the release archive.
