# PedCols
This mod adds varying pedestrian colours to GTA Vice City and GTA III. Extract to your game folder to use. A pedcols.dat must be present in the data folder of the game (an example one is provided in the archive).
 
 
### To use this, the pedestrian models have to be adjusted. Alternatively, you can use converted pedestrian models from Vice City Stories. The materials for which you want colours to change must be like this:



First material- R:0 G:0xFF B:0x3C

Second material- R:0xFF G:0 B:0xAF

Third material- R:0x3C G:0 B:0xFF

Fourth material- R:0xFF G:0 B:0x3C


Then, the pedcols.dat should be adjusted accordingly. There is an example pedcols.dat in the source folder and in the release archive.
